# XENBuilder
XENBuilder is my personal small "project", which aims to collect all of the Aurora Builder .xml's that I either gathered/found online or in certain groups, 
or those I made myself, in one packaged place, for personal use of Aurora Builder and my DnD 5e Campaigns.

A lot is not my own, but I've still re-written it's sources as Xenirath or XENBuilder to clearly know which github they come from.

You are free to read/use/fork my repo, I don't really mind.

May you roll many Nat 20's, don't forget to love each other.
- Xen ;)
