			<p>After sensing your fiendish lineage pulse with dark power years ago, you've been training in the magic of lust. By touching someone with a tiny bit of your saliva, sweat or cum, you can use an action to attempt to seduce them, increasing their libido and deeply charming them for a duration of your concentration (max 1 hour). </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The creature must have an intelligence of 5 or more, and must make a wisdom saving throw against your spell DC (8 + prof + cha mod). </li>
				<li>If the creature saves, the creature becomes immune to this charm for the next 24 hours. </li>
				<li>If the creature fails, they become charmed and are deeply seduced for an hour; if the target receives damage directed from someone outside the party and allies, the target gets to save again.</li> 
				<li>Also, if the caster does something bad or trully harmful to them (safe BDSM doesn't count), or the caster loses concentration or becomes unconscious, then the spell instantly ends.</li>
				<li>The caster can end the spell as a bonus action. Only one creature can be affected by the charm at a time, and if the spell is cast or affects another creature, the first creature will stop being affected.</li>
				<li>When the spell ends, the affected creature realizes magic was used on them, but if treated well during the spell, they might not be hostile or even angry about it.</li>
			</ul>
	  		<p>While concentrating on the spell, the effect on a creature can be reinforced without ending it. To do so, you must reapply the saliva and use another use of this feature, and the target must make a wisdom saving throw with disadvantage against your spell dc. If they fail, the charm's time (an hour) is reset. If they succeed, the spell ends, wasting that use. You can use this feature an amount of times equal to your CHAmod per short or long rest.</p>

			<p> As an action, you can target one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. If the target can see you, it must succeed a Wisdom saving throw, or be charmed. The DC for the save is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. The charmed target regards you as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under your direct control, it takes your requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for your Vampiric Bite/Draining Fangs.</p>
			<p> Each time you or one of your companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts for 24 hours, until you are destroyed, until you on a different plane of existence than the target, or if you take a bonus action to end the effect. You can only have one creature charmed this way at once and you can use this trait a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier before you must complete a long rest before using it again.</p>

			<p> Instead of only one creature, you can have a number of creatures charmed this way equal to your Charisma modifier. They also have disadvantage on the saving throw, and creatures charmed this way have no recollection of their time while charmed. You can use this a number of times equal to twice your Charisma modifier.</p>
