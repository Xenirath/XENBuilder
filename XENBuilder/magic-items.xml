		<description>
			<p>A weapon forged by kings, for kings, this greatsword has a silver blade, with ebony black hilt and guards, and with a leather wrap on its second hilt. It's roughly 8ft from point to end, and has incredibly balanced weight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Craftmanship.</em></strong>This greatsword's more massive than standard, having the Reach property (10ft) and requiring a Strength score of 15 or more to wield. Also, the way it was designed makes it relatively light and very balanced, making it's true wielder able to use it without disadvantage for the purposes of Small creatures.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bane of all Evil.</em></strong> Kingmaker battles against evil constantly, even while sheathed. If an Evil creature, a Monstrosity, or an Aberration tries to touch Kingmaker, they must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or take 8d8 force damage and be forced back 15ft from the blade, as a burst of power blasts out of Kingmaker.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Boon of Kings.</em></strong> If the wielder of Kingmaker is part of nobility or has a status or title of enough importance (up to DM's discretion), the blade gives them advantage of Charisma (Persuation) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks the wielder makes, as long as they show their status while doing so.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Unbreakable Destiny.</em></strong> This greatsword is part of a universal force that drives kings and leaders to take their place as rulers and do good by their people. Kingmaker cannot be destroyed by any means, as even the most powerful of spells, Wish, only cast it out of the plane, only for it to be back to it's true wielder's hand a few days after.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> Kingmaker grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can speak, read, and write Celestial, Draconic and Sylvan.</li>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon and, on a hit, deals an extra 1d6 force damage.</li>
				<li>If the creature hit is Evil aligned, a Monstrosity, or an Aberration, it takes an additional 2d4 force damage on a hit.</li>

	<element name="Deck of Many Futures" type="Magic Item" source="XENBuild" id="ID_XENBUILDER_MAGIC_ITEM_DECK_OF_MANY_FUTURES">
		<description>
			<p>This deck made of old wooden cards resembles the 7 Mayor Arcanas, and you can use it to channel divination magic and get information about what the future holds for this day.</p>
			<p>Once each dawn, you can make a 1 minute ritual to get a glimpse of the future. When you do, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the result of the roll is known, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</p>
			<p class="indent"> As part of the ritual, roll 1d8 to see which Arcana will be present during your divination and the day ahead: </p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>1 - The Knight:</strong></em> You have fierce battles ahead. This Arcana gives you advantage on one attack or initiative roll.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>2 - The Noble:</strong></em> You have intricate politics ahead. This Arcana gives you advantage on one charisma roll or an instant success on an insight check.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>3 - The Rogue:</strong></em> You have to be subtle to succeed on this day. This Arcana gives you advantage on one dexterity roll or the ability to cast Pass Without Trace only on yourself for up to a minute (without concentration).</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>4 - The Athlete:</strong></em> You'll need all your strength today. This Arcana gives you advantage on one strength roll or the ability to duplicate your speed for up to a minute.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>5 - The Scout:</strong></em> You'll need to deeply grasp your surroundings today. This Arcana gives you advantage on one wisdom roll or get blindsight (15ft) for 1 minute. </p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>6 - The Sage:</strong></em> You'll need all your knowledge today. This Arcana gives you advantage on one intelligence roll or the ability to magically recall one accessible piece of information.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>7 - The Bastion:</strong></em> You'll need all your resistance today. This Arcana gives you advantage on one constitution roll or if you drop to 0hp, you can stabilize yourself.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>8 - The Jester:</strong></em> You don't know shit. This Arcana gives you inspiration and you'll recieve a whisper today that will help you in a moment of need.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your spells while attuned to this magic item.</p>
