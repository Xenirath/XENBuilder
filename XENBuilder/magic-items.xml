			<p>A weapon forged by kings, for kings, this greatsword has a silver blade, with ebony black hilt and guards, and with a leather wrap on its second hilt. It's roughly 8ft from point to end, and has incredibly balanced weight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bane of all Evil.</em></strong> Kingmaker battles against evil constantly, even while sheathed. If an Evil creature, a Monstrosity, or an Aberration tries to touch Kingmaker, they must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or take 8d8 force damage and be forced back 15ft from the blade, as a burst of power blasts out of Kingmaker.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Boon of Kings.</em></strong> If the wielder of Kingmaker is part of nobility or has a status or title of enough importance (up to DM's discretion), the blade gives them advantage of Charisma (Persuation) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks the wielder makes, as long as they show their status while doing so.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Unbreakable Destiny.</em></strong> This greatsword is part of a universal force that drives kings and leaders to take their place as rulers and do good by their people. Kingmaker cannot be destroyed by any means, as even the most powerful of spells, Wish, only cast it out of the plane, only for it to be back to it's true wielder's hand a few days after.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> Kingmaker grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can speak, read, and write Celestial, Draconic and Sylvan.</li>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon and, on a hit, deals an extra 1d6 force damage.</li>
				<li>If the creature hit is Evil, a Monstrosity, or an Aberration, it takes an additional 2d4 force damage on a hit.</li>
