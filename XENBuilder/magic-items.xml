		<description>
			<p>A weapon forged by kings, for kings, this greatsword has a silver blade, with ebony black hilt and guards, and with a leather wrap on its second hilt. It's roughly 8ft from point to end, and has incredibly balanced weight.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Craftmanship.</em></strong>This greatsword's more massive than standard, having the Reach property (10ft) and requiring a Strength score of 15 or more to wield. Also, the way it was designed makes it relatively light and very balanced, making it's true wielder able to use it without disadvantage for the purposes of Small creatures.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bane of all Evil.</em></strong> Kingmaker battles against evil constantly, even while sheathed. If an Evil creature, a Monstrosity, or an Aberration tries to touch Kingmaker, they must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or take 8d8 force damage and be forced back 15ft from the blade, as a burst of power blasts out of Kingmaker.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Boon of Kings.</em></strong> If the wielder of Kingmaker is part of nobility or has a status or title of enough importance (up to DM's discretion), the blade gives them advantage of Charisma (Persuation) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks the wielder makes, as long as they show their status while doing so.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Unbreakable Destiny.</em></strong> This greatsword is part of a universal force that drives kings and leaders to take their place as rulers and do good by their people. Kingmaker cannot be destroyed by any means, as even the most powerful of spells, Wish, only cast it out of the plane, only for it to be back to it's true wielder's hand a few days after.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> Kingmaker grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can speak, read, and write Celestial, Draconic and Sylvan.</li>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon and, on a hit, deals an extra 1d6 force damage.</li>
				<li>If the creature hit is Evil aligned, a Monstrosity, or an Aberration, it takes an additional 2d4 force damage on a hit.</li>

		<description>
			<p>This deck made of old wooden cards resembles the 7 Mayor Arcanas, and you can use it to channel divination magic and get information about what the future holds for this day.</p>
			<p>Once each dawn, you can make a 1 minute ritual to get a glimpse of the future. When you do, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the result of the roll is known, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</p>
			<p class="indent"> As part of the ritual, roll 1d8 to see which Arcana will be present during your divination and the day ahead: </p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>1 - The Knight:</strong></em> You have fierce battles ahead. This Arcana gives you advantage on one attack or initiative roll.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>2 - The Noble:</strong></em> You have intricate politics ahead. This Arcana gives you advantage on one charisma roll or an instant success on an insight check.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>3 - The Rogue:</strong></em> You have to be subtle to succeed on this day. This Arcana gives you advantage on one dexterity roll or the ability to cast Pass Without Trace only on yourself for up to a minute (without concentration).</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>4 - The Athlete:</strong></em> You'll need all your strength today. This Arcana gives you advantage on one strength roll or the ability to duplicate your speed for up to a minute.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>5 - The Scout:</strong></em> You'll need to deeply grasp your surroundings today. This Arcana gives you advantage on one wisdom roll or get blindsight (15ft) for 1 minute. </p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>6 - The Sage:</strong></em> You'll need all your knowledge today. This Arcana gives you advantage on one intelligence roll or the ability to magically recall one accessible piece of information.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>7 - The Bastion:</strong></em> You'll need all your resistance today. This Arcana gives you advantage on one constitution roll or if you drop to 0hp, you can stabilize yourself.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>8 - The Jester:</strong></em> You don't know shit. This Arcana gives you inspiration and you'll recieve a whisper today that will help you in a moment of need.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The interior of this suit of iron armor is lined with brutal spikes. Donning the armor is an excruciating procedure that binds it to your body by piercing your flesh. Your hit point maximum is reduced by a number equal to your character level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll a d100. If the number rolled is greater than your new hit point maximum, you immediately die and the attunement fails.</p>
			<p> The armor suspends your lifeforce while you are imprisoned within it, and grows in power as your blood is spilled, feeding off of your agony to fuel its magic. </p>
			<p>While wearing the armor you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have a +1 bonus to AC.</li>
				<li>You are immune to exhaustion and the frightened condition.</li>
				<li><strong><em>Death Howl.</em></strong> When damage drops you to 0 hit points, you can emanate a psychic wail of agony and drop to 1 hit point instead. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage equal to the damage you took. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> If you drop below half of your maximum hit points (rounded down), you gain the following benefits: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your bonus to AC is incresed to +2.</li>
				<li><strong><em>Bloody Vigor.</em></strong> Once on each of your turns, when you hit with an attack or deal damage with a spell, you can deal an extra 2d8 damage to one of the targets. If the target is a creature, you gain temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> If you drop below a quarter of your maximum hit points (rounded down), you gain the following benefits: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your bonus to AC is increased to +3. </li>
				<li>The extra damage from Bloody Vigor increases to 4d8. </li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong><em> Curse.</em></strong> The armor cannot be removed unless this curse is broken via the remove curse or wish spell. If the armor is removed, the magic that sustained your mangled body ends. You immediately drop to 0 hit points and you have disadvantage on death saving throws for the next 1d6 days.</p>
			<p class="flavor"> For the Knights of The Crimson Tears, being elected Warden is no privilege. It is a duty-bound service on their honor that, one day, they may be called upon to don the Iron Maiden. If duty calls for the Warden to fulfill their agonizing promise, no evil may escape once the armor weeps for its wielder.</p>

			<p class="flavor"> Pain must be brought, willingly or not.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Suffering.</em></strong> The Knout of Torment can only be used by an evil creature, who's main mission is to deal pain to others. For this cause, the whip deals 3d4 necrotic or radiant damage (your choice).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Willing Whip's Will.</em></strong> While attuned to the weapon, you have a certain link of communication to the Maiden of Pain. This channel goes both ways. If the wielder tries to do something that would be considered selfless or good-hearted (DM's discretion), they have to make a Charisma saving throw (DC 12) or take 1d10 damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> The whip grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Infernal.</li>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</li>
				<li>You can call upon The Scourge Mistress to bring pain and misery to your enemies. As an action, choose a creature within 30ft that you can see, and they have to make a Dexterity saving throw. They take 6d6 necrotic or radiant damage (your choice) and are restrained by the whip, as 9 bloody hooks cleave into their bodies. They stay restrained until you release them (as a free action), they force themselves out, or a creature uses an action to remove the hooks from their body. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not restrained. You can do this once per long rest.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Banehold's Aura.</em></strong> While attuned to this weapon, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p>

			<p class="flavor"> Pain must be brought, willingly or not.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Suffering.</em></strong> The Knout of Torment can only be used by an evil creature, who's main mission is to deal pain to others. For this cause, the whip deals 3d4 necrotic or radiant damage (your choice).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Willing Whip's Will.</em></strong> While attuned to the weapon, you have a certain link of communication to the Maiden of Pain. This channel goes both ways. If the wielder tries to do something that would be considered selfless or good-hearted (DM's discretion), they have to make a Charisma saving throw (DC 12) or take 1d10 damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Dormant.</em></strong> The whip grants the following benefits in its dormant state:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Infernal.</li>
				<li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</li>
				<li>You can call upon The Scourge Mistress to bring pain and misery to your enemies. As an action, choose a creature within 30ft that you can see, and they have to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13). They take 6d6 necrotic or radiant damage (your choice) and are restrained by the whip, as 9 bloody hooks cleave into their bodies. They stay restrained until you release them (as a free action), they force themselves out, or a creature uses an action to remove the hooks from their body. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not restrained. You can do this once per long rest.</li>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Banehold's Aura.</em></strong> While attuned to this weapon, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Awakened.</em></strong> When the whip reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.</li>
				<li>The damage from the Mistress Call becomes 8d6, and the DC increases to 15 and you can use it 2 times per long rest now.</li>
				<li>As an action, you can look into a creatures eyes and strike pure fear into their souls. That creature has to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) or be paralyzed for 1d4 turns. The creature can try to save and the end of each of their turns.</li>

	<element name="Ring of Dracula" type="Magic Item" source="XENBuilder" id="ID_XENBUILDER_MAGIC_ITEM_RING_OF_DRACULA">
		<description>
			<p class="flavor"> This magical ring is covered in a layer of gold, its black obsidian material becoming evident in the engravings that adorn it. At its crown, sits a crimson gem that radiates status and nobility.</p>
			<p><strong><em>The Ring:</em></strong> This magnificent ring was said to have been worn by the famed Dracula himself and in the eons he wore it, it took on magical properties as it was warped by his powerful unnatural presence. While wearing this ring you gain the following benefits: </p>
			<ul>
				<li> You no longer possess any of the weakness a vampires has and are immune to the effects of sunlight. </li>
				<li> If your coffinic structure is further then 2 hours away but on the same plane of existence you reach it within two hours and regain all lost hit points once you've rested there for an hour. </li>
				<li> You can go for a month without needing to consume blood. </li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong><em>Dracula:</em></strong> Your natural vampirism is elevated to the peak of its power as it is suffused with the legendary strength of the Dracula. In addition, to the benefits granted by your vampire spawn and true vampire traits, with the exception of the vampire spawn's Spawn trait, you gain the following benefits: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong><em>Enhanced Fangs.</em></strong> Your Bite now reduces the hit point maximum of the creature by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and you regain hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</li>
				<li><strong><em>Enhanced Talons.</em></strong> Your Claws / Talons now deal 2d8 slashing damage and on a successful attack, you can grapple the creature as a bonus action.</li>
				<li><strong><em>Vampiric Resistance.</em></strong> You are resistant to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage (non-silvered). If you were, you are now immune. </li>
				<li><strong><em>Vampiric Regeneration.</em></strong> You gain 10 temporary hit points at the start of your turn if you have at least 1 hit point.</li>
				<li><strong><em>Enhanced Vampirism.</em></strong> All vampires feats you possess are enhanced, as seen in the Enhanced Vampirism Table.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong><em>Legendary Actions (3):</em></strong> You can take 3 legendary actions (the amount doesn't add up to other legendary actions the creature might have, but they get additional options to choose from), choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. You regain spent legendary actions at the start of your turn. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong><em>Endure.</em></strong> The next time you receive damage, the damage received is halved as if you were resistant to it, unless its radiant or fire damage, or it comes from sunlight or running water.</li>
				<li><strong><em>Death Grip</em></strong>. You move up to your movement speed towards an enemy and try to grapple them by grabbing their neck or another vulnerable part. If you succeed the check, their are restrained by an invisible dark force until you let them go or they succeed on the check.</li>
				<li><strong><em>Dominate Person (Costs 2 Actions; Recharges on a 5-6).</em></strong> You cast the "Dominate Person" spell. The enemy has to make the save against your spellcasting DC (From your Int/Wis/Cha, depending on you) or suffer the effects of the spell as normal.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3):</em></strong> While you may not be of legendary status like the great Dracula, his ring elevates you to such a position. If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this three times before the next dawn. If the creature already had Legendary Resistances of their own, add +1 to their max, not 3. </p>
			<p><strong><em>Curse:</em></strong> Once attuned to the Ring of Dracula you cannot unattune to it and the only way to remove it from your person is to destroy you. </p>
			<p><strong><em>Destroying the Ring of Dracula:</em></strong> The Ring of Dracula is indestructible like most artifacts, however, it can be destroyed by being swallowed by a good-aligned solar or some of the other more powerful good entities of the upper planes. </p>

        <description>
            <p>This reinforced, jet black leather armor is covered in archaic, eldritch runes. It seems to stick tightly to your skin and feels cool to the touch.</p>
            <p class="indent">While you are wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>+2 bonus</strong> to your <strong>AC</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Advantage</strong> on saving throws against being <strong>charmed or frightened.</strong></li>
				<li>You learn the <strong>eldritch blast</strong> cantrip, and can cast it at will. You only know the spell while attuned to the armor, and if you unattune, you forget how to cast it (unless you learn it by other means).</li>
				<li>Casting any <strong>damaging cantrip</strong>, <strong>except</strong> for eldritch blast, automatically makes the armor <strong>cast eldritch blast against the target</strong>, but only conjuring <strong>2 blasts</strong>, no matter your level.</li>
				<li><strong>If you cast eldritch blast</strong>, the armor empowers you, <strong>increasing</strong> the damage towards the target as if they were <strong>Hexed</strong>. This requires no concentration or spells slots used, as the spell isn't actually cast, but you still gain the 1d6 damage increase per blast.</li>
