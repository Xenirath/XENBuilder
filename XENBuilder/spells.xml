			<p class="flavor">You conjure an orb that pulls foes towards it.</p>
			<p>You create a magical orb of iron at a point of your choice within range. The orb is 3 feet in diameter, and floats 2 feet above the ground. Each creature that starts it's turn within 20 feet of the orb must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be pulled 10 feet towards the orb. Any creature within 20 feet of the orb must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving away from the orb. Any creature that touches the orb must make a Strenght saving throw or take 1d10 lightning damage. Unattended inanimate objects that weigh 5 pounds or less within 20 feet of the orb are also pulled towards it at a rate of 10 feet per round. The caster cannot be affected by the orb's effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum range that the orb's pulling can reach increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.</p>

		<description>
			<p class="flavor"> You rip the weave from someone to attack another target.</p>
			<p> Make a ranged spell attack against a creature 30 feet from you. That creature, if not willing, must make a wisdom saving throw. If it fails, they take 1d10 force damage, and you must select another creature within 30 feet of the target to also take the same damage. If the creature is willing, both chained creatures instead take 2d10. The first target also loses a spell slot (if it has any) of a level equal to the casting of this spell. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

		<description>
			<p class="flavor">You meld with the shadows around you, which provides you with extra movement.</p>
			<p>You become shrouded in shadow and for the duration after casting this spell you gain the ability to meld with the darkness for the purpose of travelling around an area, unseen. As long as you are standing in an area that is dark or dim lit, you may, on your turn, merge with the darkness, becoming one with it and doubling your movement speed while merged. You can enter and exit any surface including the floor, a wall or the celling as long as it has a shadow large enough for you body. You can emerge from the shadow of any creature considered one size larger than you. The moment you emerge you are considered hidden because you appear as shadow but when you leave the dark area you may be spotted. The shadow you emerge from is tangible to you and you may cling to it.</p>

     			<p>Your body quickens and phases, slightly superimposing itself over the fabric of time itself, and you gain the following effects:</p>
     			<p class="indent"> Your movement speed is doubled.</p>
			<p class="indent"> You get an extra Action on each of your turns.</p>
			<p class="indent"> You have advantage on all of your attacks, and everyone has disadvantage on all </p>
			<p class="indent"> attacks targeting you.</p>
			<p> When this spell ends, your body suffers the consequences of the acceleration, as the fabric of time violently latches onto it again:</p>
     			<p class="indent"> You gain one level of Exhaustion, and you are Paralyzed until the end of your next </p>
			<p class="indent"> turn, as your body's mass gets accustomed to the natural flow of time. </p>
			<p class="indent"> Additionally, make a Constitution saving throw (DC 20). On a failure, you take 4d8 </p>
			<p class="indent"> force damage.</p>
